    Scan a Git repository for changes in IaC vulnerabilities in the received pushed commits.
    This is intended to be used as a pre-receive hook.

    The scan is successful if no *new* IaC vulnerability was found, unless `--all` is used,
    in which case the scan is only successful if no IaC vulnerability (old and new) was found.

    By default, the output will show:
    - The number of known IaC vulnerabilities resolved by the changes
    - The number of known IaC vulnerabilities left untouched
    - The number and the list of new IaC vulnerabilities introduced by the changes

    It is the remote equivalent of the `iac scan pre-push` command.

    Note that it is not currently possible to scan a specific sub-directory of the repo.
